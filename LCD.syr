INFO:Xst:738 - HDL ADVISOR - 257 flip-flops were inferred for signal <chars_hold>. You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.
    Summary:
	inferred   1 Finite State Machine(s).
	inferred   1 ROM(s).
	inferred   1 Counter(s).
	inferred 314 D-type flip-flop(s).
	inferred   3 Adder/Subtractor(s).
	inferred   8 Comparator(s).
	inferred   8 Multiplexer(s).
Unit <LCD> synthesized.

INFO:Xst:1767 - HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.
